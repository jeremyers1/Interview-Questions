# Interview-Questions
Questions I *hear* get asked in interviews

I have not been through a development interview yet. But I hope to be soon. 

As I listen to and learn from other developers, here are some interview questions I hear that can get asked.

I am making this list so I can make sure I have studied them before any interview.

2. What is encapsulation and explain why it is helpful for programming?
3. What is currying and how is it helpful for programming?
4. What is hoisting?
5. What are closures, and describe a time where you would use it.
6. Describe asynchronous js vs async. 
7. Describe what happens when a script is run. (explain global execution context, event loops, code blocking tasks queue, the stack, etc). 
8. How would you setup/define a class component in react? 
9. Explain the four pillars of OOP. 
10. Explain prototype chaining. 
11. What goes in the head tag?
